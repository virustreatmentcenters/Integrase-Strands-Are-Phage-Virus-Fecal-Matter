Integrase strands are fecal matter of virus cells. The fecal matter wraps itself around cells. When microphages erupt from the integrase strand, they tear up anything the strand is attached to like a shape charge explosive. When phages back their bodies into cavities like hermit crabs, they eject integrase strands into the cavities. This is why scientists previously believed that viruses inject DNA into cells.
